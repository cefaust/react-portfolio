# React Portfolio

## Description
I am creating this Portfolio to show potential employers a single page application with working examples
so they can assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.

## Things I included in this app
1. When the user loads the page. They are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
2. When the user views the header. They are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to
the different sections of the portfolio.
3. When the user views the navigation. They are presented with the titles Home, About Me, Portfolio, Contact Me, and Resume.

reloading and the title is highlighted.
